 * This code solves the Tape Equilibrium problem using a prefix sum approach.
 * It is a standard algorithmic technique for efficiently calculating sums of subarrays and their differences.
 * Prefix sums are commonly used in array partitioning and equilibrium problems.
 * So yes, it uses a well-known algorithmic method.

    /**
     * Key fixes in this code:
     * 1-We loop only until i < A.length - 1, so the right part always has at least one element. This avoids the invalid scenario of an empty right side
     * stackoverflow.com
     * .
     * 2-minDiff is initialized to a very large value (Long.MAX_VALUE), ensuring any real difference will be smaller. Alternatively, we could initialize minDiff to the difference of the first valid split (after the first iteration) â€“ both approaches prevent the negative/zero initialization issue
     * medium.com
     * . We also use a long type for minDiff, leftSum, and totalSum to guard against overflow with extreme inputs.
     * 2-We calculate diff using Math.abs(...) to ensure it is non-negative, and we update minDiff properly. The result returned is cast to int because the minimal difference will always be within the range of 0 to a value well below the 32-bit integer limit (under problem constraints, the worst-case difference is around 100 million
     * medium.com
     * , which is safely an int).
